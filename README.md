# Arduino_Projects

These projects are based on the introductory projects of the arduino projects book. 

I'm using arduino uno R3 based on ATmega328P.

Starting form project 03, with additional knowledge, I try to add a personal twist and implementation to the standard project that is called 'Project_number'_special.

At the moment this repository contains all the projects, that are in a rough state, and will develop over time, once I gather more knowledge.
